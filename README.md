- When to use forEach
- Use forEach as much as possible with lists, arrays

## Module02Lesson11ForEachExcercise
- Console App that asks firstname
- adds user input into list
- then displays the user input using foreach loop

## Module02Lesson12Methods
- Learn how to use methods
- why methods are important
- Concept of DRY Do not repeat yourself
- Global variables
- How to create and call methods

## Module02Lesson12MethodsExcercise
- Console app to create two methods
- One method asks user for username
- Another method welcomes user by printing "Hello username"

## UsingBreakPointsDemo
- Create breakpoint by clicking the grey area
- Use locals to watch the existing variables
- Create breakpoints at different points
- Remove breakpoints by clicking on the breakpoint or Debug > Toggle Breakpoint

## ExceptionHandlingDemo
- How to handle exception using try and catch
- Try tries to execute a code
- catch catches and error and throws exception

## AdvancedExceptionDemo
- Different types of exception
- Use try catch
