# C-sharp-fundamentals
This repo is created to track and record learning C# 

## HelloWorldApplication
- Learn how to create a C# (.Net Framework) console app
- Learn about Console.Write, Console.WriteLine(), Console.ReadLine() methods
- Learn how to build and run C# app

## Module02Lesson02Variables
- Learn about different types of variables (string, int, double, decimal, boolean)
- Learn to declare a variable
- Learn to use a variable
- Strings (Learn about escaping characters, string literal, string interpolation)
- Difference between double and decimal 
- Identify when to use int and string

## Module02Lesson02VariablesExcercise
This app was created to implement learning from Module02Lesson02Variables and uses following C# features
- Use Console.Write to output message
- Use Console.ReadLine() to collect data from user and assign it to variable
- Use bool and while loop to collect age data from user 
- Use int.TryParse() method to convert string into integer age
- Use Console.Clear() to clear console screen

## Module02Lesson03Conditionals
- Learn about if / else if / else conditonal statements
- Learn about &&, ||, == operators
- Learn about switch statements
- Learn about .ToLower() method

## Module02Lesson03ConditionalsExcercise
- Practise if else conditional statements
- Console app to welcome Tim Corey as professor and others as students

## Module02Lesson04Conversion
- Convert string to int
- Learn how to use int.TryParse and int.Parse methods
- Combining int.TryParse methods with if/else conditions

## Module02Lesson04ConversionExcercise
- Console app asks for user age and calculates how old user was in the year 2000
- While loop is used to ensure correct age is entered by user
- if / else statement is used to display results

## HomeWorkConditionalsConversion
- Mini project to practise if/else conditon
- Convert string to int
- Perform subtraction operation on string interpolation
- Practise writing pseudocode

## Module02Lesson06Loops
- While Loop (runs 0 or more times)
- Do while loop (runs 1 or more times)
- Looping is important to ensure user enters correct data or to perform any kind of validation

## Module02Lesson06LoopsExcercise
- Ask for the users name. If users name is Tim, say "Hello Professor" otherwise, say hi username until they type exit
- Do while loop is chosen as the code needs to run at least once
- If / else statemennt is used inside loop for conditional check

## Module02Lesson07Arrays

- Accessing array element 
- Array length and indexing

## Module02Lesson07ArraysExcercise
